# Sprint 1 (Sep 27 – Oct 10, 2025)

## Key Accomplishments
- Set up GitHub repository (`odin-foundations`) with README and license.
- Created `assets/` folder and added a minimalist banner image.
- Learned and practiced Git basics: staging, committing, branching, pushing.
- Organized notes into `progress/chapters/` subfolder for better structure.
- Added `COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md` cheat sheet to track commit message guidelines.

## Skills Improved
- Git & GitHub workflow (add, commit, push, managing files).
- Markdown formatting for documentation.
- Project organization strategies (folders, modular notes).
- Writing professional commit messages.

## Reflections
- Learned that exact file paths and filenames are crucial in Git (`assets/odin-banner.png` vs `assets/odin_banner.png`).
- Splitting notes into modular files makes the repo easier to maintain.
- Balancing daily micro-progress tracking in Excel with milestone logging in Markdown feels sustainable.

## Goals for Sprint 2
- Continue working through Odin Project Foundations curriculum.
- Add more chapter notes into `progress/chapters/`.
- Maintain consistency with commit messages using the cheat sheet.
- Expand `progress.md` with navigation links to new chapters and sprint logs.
